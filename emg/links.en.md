#### Academic societies, associations, institutions

- [The International Society of Electrophysiology and Kinesiology (ISEK)](https://isek.org/) is a multidisciplinary organization composed of members from the health related and the engineering fields. 
- [The International Society of Biomechanics (ISB)](https://isbweb.org/) promotes the study of all areas of Biomechanics at the international level.
- [International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (ISPRM)](https://www.isprm.org/). ISPRM is the result of the merger of the International Rehabilitation Medicine Association (IRMA) and the International Federation of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (IFPMR). As non-governmental organization (NGO) in relation with the World Health Organization (WHO), as an international umbrella organization of rehabilitation physicians, and as a catalyst for international rehabilitation research, ISPRM has a humanitarian, civil societal, professional, and scientific mandate.
- The mission of [ESPRM](https://www.esprm.net/) is 
    - to be the leading scientific European Society for physicians in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) and,
    - to improve the knowledge of fundamentals and the management of activities, participation and contextual factors of people with a disability and 
    - to improve and maintain a strong connection between research and clinical practice in PRM.
- [International Society of Biomechanics in Sport](https://isbs.org/) Primary Purposes: 
    - To provide a forum for the exchange of ideas for sports biomechanics researchers, coaches and teachers, 
    - To bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners,
    - To gather and disseminate information and materials on biomechanics in sports.
- The purpose of [ESMAC](https://www.esmac.org) (European Society of Movement Analysis for Adults and Children) is to stimulate and advance scientific knowledge, professional interaction and the exchange of ideas among Society members relating to movement analysis in adults and children in clinical and research settings. ESMAC is multidisciplinary by nature, mainly interacting clinical and bioengineering disciplines, and ranging from basic sciences to applied practices. Our members are orthopaedic surgeons, physiatrist, physiotherapists, human movement scientists, biomechanical and biomedical engineers; as well as many others.
- [NIOSH - National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ergonomics) The goal of ergonomics is to prevent soft tissue injuries and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) caused by sudden or sustained exposure to force, vibration, repetitive motion, and awkward posture. To create an ergonomically sound work environment, NIOSH ergonomists and industrial hygienists recommend designing tasks, work spaces, controls, displays, tools, lighting, and equipment to fit employeeís physical capabilities and limitations. 
- [ENMC](https://www.enmc.org/default4.html) - European NeuroMuscular Centre. Most neuromuscular disorders are rare (orphan) diseases, meaning that fewer than 1 in 2000 people are affected. They all cause a weakening of muscles, which leads to serious disability and are often life-threatening. Because of this, international collaboration is extremely important†to accelerate our knowledge and discovery of new medicines in the field of neuromuscular diseases.

Effective precision rehabilitation enables improved effectiveness (clinical and cost) as it identifies which patients to target with rehabilitation, when and how to target them; and therefore enables more effective use of rehabilitation resources.
- The scientific expertise of the [Department of Rehabilitation and Prevention Engineering](https://www.ame.rwth-aachen.de/cms/AME/Forschung/~nzic/RPE-Rehabilitations-und-Praeventionst/?lidx=1), RPE, focuses on the development and implementation of new assistive technologies in order to prevent musculoskeletal dysfunction and restore motor function. The objective is the development of new processes and techniques to support doctors during diagnosis, therapy planning and evaluation by means of objective data.
- [Roessingh Research and Development Research Centre (RRD)](https://www.rrd.nl) is the biggest center in the Netherlands where a wide range of disciplines such as rehabilitation medicine, movement sciences, psychology, physiotherapy, biomedical sciences and computer sciences work together under a single roof on current and future innovations in rehabilitation and chronic care. As an internationally recognized scientific research institute, RRD occupies a unique position between the university and healthcare practice.

- [FutureHealth](https://www.futurehealth.org/semg.htm) educational material on surface EMG.
- [Biofeedback Network](https://www.biofeedback.net) and online biofeedback resources.  Biofeedback is a learning process that helps you gain control of your bodyís responses to stress, anxiety, physical strain and emotional stimuli.  Biofeedback is the use of instruments to reflect physiological conditions. With this information, a person may be able to effect change upon body areas previously not under volitional control. It can monitor muscle tension, heart-rate, blood pressure, peripheral blood flow (vasoconstriction) and galvanic skin response, EEG brain waves and others.
