    sEMG may be used to control prosthesis, external devices, toys, rehabilitation games, lights or
    sounds. This demonstration video was prepared by Dr Corrado Cescon within a project sponsored by
    the Giovanni Goria Foundation, Asti, Italy). A number of pre-recorded sounds are activated by the
    sEMG detected from a few muscles and their volume or frequency are controlled by the signal
    amplitude.
