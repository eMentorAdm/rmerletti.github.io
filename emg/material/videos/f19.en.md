Two grids of 4x8 electrodes are placed on the right and left upper and middle trapezius

Signals are detected differentially in the fiber direction. Maps are interpolated and show the distribution of the root mean square signal (RMS) computed on epochs of 0.125s.

Electrodes: Ã˜=3mm, interelectrode distance = 10mm.
