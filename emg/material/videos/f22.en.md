One grid of  16x2 bar electrodes (10x1mm, interelectrode distance = 10 mm) is applied on each side of the  back of a rower between T10 and L5.  Map of RMS computed on epochs of 0.125 s for the longitudinal differential signal.  The frame rate is reduced from 30 to 10 frames/s. The dot is the centroid of each frame. Observe the asymmetry of muscle activation.
